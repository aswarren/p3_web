    <b><h3>Paired read library</h3></b>
    <!--<p>Paired-end sequencing has advantages over the use of single reads. Paired-end reads give added structure to the genome assembly problem which can be useful when dealing with ambiguous or low complexity regions.</p>-->
    <p><b>Read File 1 & 2</b></br>
    Many paired read libraries are given as file pairs, with each file containing half of each read pair. Paired read files are expected to be sorted such that each read in a pair occurs in the same Nth position as its mate in their respective files. These files are specified as READ FILE 1 and READ FILE 2. For a given file pair, the selection of which file is READ 1 and which is READ 2 does not matter.</p>
